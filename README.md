`Business Objective`

Sales prediction Using big mart Data:

The dataset corresponds to Big mart, a retail outlet. The dataset consists of various details about the items sold and the outlets where the items are sold. 
The dataset also contains the total sales value of the outlet for a given item. This data can be used to predict the sales of these outlets for the items in future. 
This prediction can help management make careful decisions on various factors such as labor resources to use, open outlets in areas where sales is high, sell more of the item (or item types) in demand. 
It also helps make decisions on outlets or items which are not performing well. 

This prediction can also determine if the oulet performs as per expectations and make changes to strategy accordingly for better sales and profits. 

The clusters we have formed below, and the plots drawn based on the clusters help make the following decisions and devise the following strategies.

  * The clusters are grouped based on how much sales they make. This helps us understand and devise marketing strategies accordingly. 

  * The cluster with stores, location and item types that contribute to least sales value. Hence we can devise a strategy accordingly to increase the sales in these locations and item_types.

  * The stores, locations and item_types in the cluster that make the most sales, hence we can bring more store of those types, locations and item_types.

  * Items with low visibility make more sales, than items with high visibility. Decisions can be made based on this insight.  

Apart from clutsers, predictions can be made for future years and outlets on how the sales will be and business can be prepared accordingly.
